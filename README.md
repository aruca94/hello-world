## Hi there! My name is Josh!
### I am from a small south eastern Kentucky county, but now reside in scott county just outside of Lexington. I currently work at an aerospace machine shop in Winchester KY and have a passion for web development. My goals are to successfully complete this program and change careers to something in tech.
